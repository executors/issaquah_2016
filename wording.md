## Requirements

### Customization point objects

*(The following text has been adapted from the draft Ranges Technical Specification.)*

A *customization point object* is a function object (C++ Std, [function.objects]) with a literal class type that interacts with user-defined types while enforcing semantic requirements on that interaction.

The type of a customization point object shall satisfy the requirements of `CopyConstructible` (C++Std [copyconstructible]) and `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]).

All instances of a specific customization point object type shall be equal.

Let `t` be a (possibly const) customization point object of type `T`, and `args...` be a parameter pack expansion of some parameter pack `Args...`. The customization point object `t` shall be callable as `t(args...)` when the types of `Args...` meet the requirements specified in that customization point object's definition. Otherwise, `T` shall not have a function call operator that participates in overload resolution.

Each customization point object type constrains its return type to satisfy some particular type requirements.

The library defines several named customization point objects. In every translation unit where such a name is defined, it shall refer to the same instance of the customization point object.

[*Note:* Many of the customization points objects in the library evaluate function call expressions with an unqualified name which results in a call to a user-defined function found by argument dependent name lookup (C++Std [basic.lookup.argdep]). To preclude such an expression resulting in a call to unconstrained functions with the same name in namespace `std`, customization point objects specify that lookup for these expressions is performed in a context that includes deleted overloads matching the signatures of overloads defined in namespace `std`. When the deleted overloads are viable, user-defined overloads must be more specialized (C++Std [temp.func.order]) to be used by a customization point object. *--end note*]

### `Future` requirements

A type `F` meets the `Future` requirements for some value type `T` if `F` is `std::experimental::future<T>` (defined in the C++ Concurrency TS, ISO/IEC TS 19571:2016).  [*Note:* This concept is included as a placeholder to be elaborated, with the expectation that the elaborated requirements for `Future` will expand the applicability of some executor customization points. *--end note*]

### `ProtoAllocator` requirements

A type `A` meets the `ProtoAllocator` requirements if `A` is `CopyConstructible` (C++Std [copyconstructible]), `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]), and `allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<U>` meets the allocator requirements (C++Std [allocator.requirements]), where `U` is an object type. [*Note:* For example, `std::allocator<void>` meets the proto-allocator requirements but not the allocator requirements. *--end note*] No comparison operator, copy operation, move operation, or swap operation on these types shall exit via an exception.

### `ExecutionContext` requirements

A type meets the `ExecutionContext` requirements if it satisfies the `EqualityComparable` requirements (C++Std [equalitycomparable]). No comparison operator on these types shall exit via an exception.

### `BaseExecutor` requirements

A type `X` meets the `BaseExecutor` requirements if it satisfies the requirements of `CopyConstructible` (C++Std [copyconstructible]), `Destructible` (C++Std [destructible]), and `EqualityComparable` (C++Std [equalitycomparable]), as well as the additional requirements listed below.

No comparison operator, copy operation, move operation, swap operation, or member function `context` on these types shall exit via an exception.

The executor copy constructor, comparison operators, `context` member function, associated execution functions, and other member functions defined in refinements (TODO: what should this word be?) of the `BaseExecutor` requirements shall not introduce data races as a result of concurrent calls to those functions from different threads.

The destructor shall not block pending completion of the submitted function objects. [*Note:* The ability to wait for completion of submitted function objects may be provided by the associated execution context. *--end note*]

In the Table \ref{base_executor_requirements} below, `x1` and `x2` denote (possibly const) values of type `X`, `mx1` denotes an xvalue of type `X`, and `u` denotes an identifier.

Table: (Base executor requirements) \label{base_executor_requirements}

| Expression   | Type       | Assertion/note/pre-/post-condition |
|--------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| `X u(x1);` | | Shall not exit via an exception. <br/><br/>*Post:* `u == x1` and `u.context() == x1.context()`. |
| `X u(mx1);` | | Shall not exit via an exception. <br/><br/>*Post:* `u` equals the prior value of `mx1` and `u.context()` equals the prior value of `mx1.context()`. |
| `x1 == x2` | `bool` | Returns `true` only if `x1` and `x2` can be interchanged with identical effects in any of the expressions defined in these type requirements (TODO and the other executor requirements defined in this Technical Specification). [*Note:* Returning `false` does not necessarily imply that the effects are not identical. *--end note*] `operator==` shall be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, and shall not exit via an exception. |
| `x1 != x2` | `bool` | Same as `!(x1 == x2)`. |
| `x1.context()` | `E&` or `const E&` where `E` is a type that satisfies the `ExecutionContext` requirements. | Shall not exit via an exception. The comparison operators and member functions defined in these requirements (TODO and the other executor requirements defined in this Technical Specification) shall not alter the reference returned by this function. |

[*Commentary: The equality operator is specified primarily as an aid to support postconditons on executor copy construction and move construction. The key word in supporting these postconditions is "interchanged". That is, if a copy is substituted for the original executor it shall produce identical effects, provided the expression, calling context, and program state are otherwise identical. Calls to the copied executor from a different context or program state are not required to produce identical effects, and this is not considered an "interchanged" use of an executor. In particular, even consecutive calls to the same executor need not produce identical effects since the program state has already altered.*]

### `OneWayExecutor` requirements

The `OneWayExecutor` requirements specify requirements for executors which create execution agents without a channel for awaiting the completion of a submitted function object and obtaining its result. [*Note:* That is, the executor provides fire-and-forget semantics. *--end note*]

A type `X` satisfies the `OneWayExecutor` requirements if it satisfies the `BaseExecutor` requirements, as well as the requirements in the table below.

In the Table below, `x` denotes a (possibly const) executor object of type `X` and `f` denotes a function object of type `F&&` callable as `DECAY_COPY(std::forward<F>(f))()` and where `decay_t<F>` satisfies the `MoveConstructible` requirements.

|------------|-------------|---------------------- |
| `x.execute(f)` | `void` | Creates an execution agent which invokes `DECAY_COPY( std::forward<F>(f))()` at most once, with the call to `DECAY_COPY` being evaluated in the thread that called `execute`. <br/> <br/> May block forward progress of the caller until `DECAY_COPY( std::forward<F>(f))()` finishes execution. <br/> <br/> The invocation of `execute` synchronizes with (C++Std [intro.multithread]) the invocation of `f`. <br/> <br/> `execute` shall not propagate any exception thrown by `DECAY_COPY( std::forward<F>(f))()` or any other function submitted to the executor. [*Note:* The treatment of exceptions thrown by one-way submitted functions is specific to the concrete executor type. *--end note.*] |

### `ThenExecutor` requirements

### `BulkOneWayExecutor` requirements

The `BulkOneWayExecutor` requirements specify requirements for executors which create groups of execution agents in bulk from a single execution function, without a channel for awaiting the completion of the submitted function object invocations and obtaining their result. [*Note:* That is, the executor provides fire-and-forget semantics. *--end note*]

A type `X` satisfies the `BulkOneWayExecutor` requirements if it satisfies the `BaseExecutor` requirements, as well as the requirements in the table below.

Creates a group of execution agents of shape `n` which invokes `DECAY_COPY( std::forward<F>(f))(i, s)` at most once for each value of `i` in the range `[0,n)`, with the call to `DECAY_COPY` being evaluated in the thread that called `bulk_execute`. <br/> <br/> May block forward progress of the caller until one or more calls to `DECAY_COPY( std::forward<F>(f))(i, s)` finish execution. <br/> <br/> The invocation of `bulk_execute` synchronizes with (C++Std [intro.multithread]) the invocations of `f`. <br/> <br/> `bulk_execute` shall not propagate any exception thrown by `DECAY_COPY( std::forward<F>(f))(i, s)` or any other function submitted to the executor. [*Note:* The treatment of exceptions thrown by bulk one-way submitted functions is specific to the concrete executor type. *--end note.*] |

## Executor properties

### In general

An executor's behavior in generic contexts is determined by a set of executor properties, and each executor property imposes certain requirements on the executor.

An executor's properties are modified by calling the `require` or `prefer` functions. These functions behave according the table below. In the table below, `x` denotes a (possibly const) executor object of type `X`, * and `p` denotes a (possibly const) property object.

| Expression | Comments |
|------------|----------|
| `x.require(p)` <br/> `require(x,p)` | Returns an executor object with the requested property `p` added to the set. All other properties of the returned executor are identical to those of `x`, except where those properties are described below as being mutually exclusive to `p`. In this case, the mutually exclusive properties are implicitly removed from the set associated with the returned executor. <br/> <br/> The expression is ill formed if an executor is unable to add the requested property. |
| `x.prefer(p)` <br/> `prefer(x,p)` | If the executor is able to add the requested property `p`, returns an executor object with the requested property added to the set. All other properties of the returned executor are identical to those of `x`, except where those properties are described below as being mutually exclusive to `p`. In this case, the mutually exclusive properties are implicitly removed from the set associated with the returned executor. <br/> <br/> Otherwise, returns a copy of `x`. |

The current value of an executor's properties can be queried by calling the `query` function. This function behaves according the table below. In the table below, `x` denotes a (possibly const) executor object of type `X`, * and `p` denotes a (possibly const) property object.

| Expression | Comments |
|------------|----------|
| `x.query(p)` | Returns a value which describes the current value of the requested property `p`. The expression is ill formed if an executor is unable to return the requested property. |

### Directionality properties

    constexpr struct oneway_t {} oneway;
    constexpr struct twoway_t {} twoway;
    constexpr struct then_t {} then;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `oneway` | The executor type satisfies the `OneWayExecutor` or `BulkOneWayExecutor` requirements. |
| `twoway` | The executor type satisfies the `TwoWayExecutor` or `BulkTwoWayExecutor` requirements. |
| `then` | The executor type satisfies the `ThenExecutor` or `BulkThenExecutor` requirements. |

The `oneway`, `twoway` and `then` properties are accumulative.

### Cardinality properties

    constexpr struct single_t {} single;
    constexpr struct bulk_t {} bulk;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `single` | The executor type satisfies the `OneWayExecutor`, `TwoWayExecutor`, or `ThenExecutor` requirements. |
| `bulk` | The executor type satisfies the `BulkOneWayExecutor`, `BulkTwoWayExecutor`, or `BulkThenExecutor` requirements. |

The `single` and `bulk` properties are accumulative.

### Blocking properties

    constexpr struct never_blocking_t {} never_blocking;
    constexpr struct possibly_blocking_t {} possibly_blocking;
    constexpr struct always_blocking_t {} always_blocking;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `never_blocking` | A call to an executor's execution function shall not block pending completion of the execution agents created by that execution function. |
| `possibly_blocking` | A call to an executor's execution function may block pending completion of one or more of the execution agents created by that execution function. |
| `always_blocking` | A call to an executor's execution function shall block until completion of all execution agents created by that execution function. |

The `never_blocking`, `possibly_blocking`, and `always_blocking` properties are mutually exclusive.

#### Properties to indicate if submitted tasks represent continuations

    constexpr struct continuation_t {} continuation;
    constexpr struct not_continuation_t {} not_continuation;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `continuation` | Function objects submitted through the executor represent continuations of the caller. If the caller is a lightweight execution agent managed by the executor or its associated execution context, the execution of the submitted function object may be deferred until the caller completes. |
| `not_continuation` | Function objects submitted through the executor do not represent continuations of the caller. |

The `continuation` and `not_continuation` properties are mutually exclusive.

### Properties to indicate likely task submission in the future

    constexpr struct outstanding_work_t {} outstanding_work;
    constexpr struct not_outstanding_work_t {} not_outstanding_work;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `outstanding_work` | The existence of the executor object represents an indication of likely future submission of a function object. The executor or its associated execution context may choose to maintain execution resources in anticipation of this submission. |
| `not_outstanding_work` | The existence of the executor object does not indicate any likely future submission of a function object. |

The `outstanding_work` and `not_outstanding_work` properties are mutually exclusive.

### Properties for bulk execution forward progress guarantees

These properties communicate the forward progress and ordering guarantees of execution agents with respect to other agents within the same bulk submission.

    constexpr struct bulk_sequenced_execution_t {} bulk_sequenced_execution;
    constexpr struct bulk_parallel_execution_t {} bulk_parallel_execution;
    constexpr struct bulk_unsequenced_execution_t {} bulk_unsequenced_execution;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `bulk_sequenced_execution` | |
| `bulk_parallel_execution` | |
| `bulk_unsequenced_execution` | |

TODO: *The meanings and relative "strength" of these categores are to be defined.
Most of the wording for `bulk_sequenced_execution`, `bulk_parallel_execution`,
and `bulk_unsequenced_execution` can be migrated from S 25.2.3 p2, p3, and
p4, respectively.*

The `bulk_sequenced_execution`, `bulk_parallel_execution`, and `bulk_unsequenced_execution` properties are mutually exclusive.

### Properties for mapping of execution on to threads

    constexpr struct thread_execution_mapping_t {} thread_execution_mapping;
    constexpr struct new_thread_execution_mapping_t {} new_thread_execution_mapping;
    constexpr struct default_execution_mapping_t {} default_execution_mapping;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `thread_execution_mapping` | Execution agents created by the executor are mapped onto threads of execution. |
| `new_thread_execution_mapping` | Each execution agent created by the executor is mapped onto a new thread of execution. |
| `default_execution_mapping` | Mapping of each execution agent created by the executor is implementation defined. |

The `thread_execution_mapping`, `new_thread_execution_mapping` and `default_execution_mapping` properties are mutually exclusive.

[*Note:* A mapping of an execution agent onto a thread of execution implies the
agent executes as-if on a `std::thread`. Therefore, the facilities provided by
`std::thread`, such as thread-local storage, are available.
`new_thread_execution_mapping` provides stronger guarantees, in
particular that thread-local storage will not be shared between execution
agents. *--end note*]

### Properties for customizing memory allocation

    template<class ProtoAllocator> struct allocator_t { ProtoAllocator alloc; };
    template<class ProtoAllocator> constexpr allocator_t<ProtoAllocator> allocator(const ProtoAllocator& a) { return {a}; }
    struct default_allocator_t {} deault_allocator;

| Property | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| `allocator(ProtoAllocator)` | Executor implementations shall use the supplied allocator to allocate any memory required to store the submitted function object. |
| `default_allocator` | Executor implementations shall use a default implmentation defined allocator to allocate any memory required to store the submitted function object. |

The `allocator(ProtoAllocator)` and `default_allocator` properties are mutually exclusive.

## Executor customization points

*Executor customization points* are functions which adapt an executor's properties. Executor customization points enable uniform use of executors in generic contexts.

When an executor customization point named *NAME* invokes a free execution function of the same name, overload resolution is performed in a context that includes the declaration `void` *NAME*`(auto&... args) = delete;`, where `sizeof...(args)` is the arity of the free execution function. This context also does not include a declaration of the executor customization point.

[*Note:* This provision allows executor customization points to call the executor's free, non-member execution function of the same name without recursion. *--end note*]

Whenever `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::`*NAME*`(`*ARGS*`)` is a valid expression, that expression satisfies the syntactic requirements for the free execution function named *NAME* with arity `sizeof...(`*ARGS*`)` with that free execution function's semantics.

### `require`

    namespace {
      constexpr unspecified prefer = unspecified;
    }

The name `require` denotes a customization point. The effect of the expression `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::require(E, P0, Pn...)` for some expressions `E` and `P0`, and where `Pn...` represents `N` expressions (where `N` is 0 or more), is equivalent to:

* `(E).require(P0)` if `N == 0` and `has_require_member_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>, decltype(P0)>` is true.

* Otherwise, `require(E, P0)` if `N == 0` and the expression is well formed.

* Otherwise, `E` if `N == 0` and:
  * `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, oneway_t>` is true and `(is_oneway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>> || is_bulk_oneway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>>)` is true; or
  * `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, twoway_t>` is true and `(is_twoway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>> || is_bulk_twoway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>>)` is true; or
  * `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, single_t>` is true and `(is_oneway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>> || is_twoway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>>)` is true; or
  * `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, bulk_t>` is true and `(is_bulk_oneway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>> || is_bulk_twoway_executor_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>>)` is true; or
  * `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, possibly_blocking_t>` is true.

* Otherwise, a value `E1` of unspecified type that holds a copy of `E` if `N == 0` and `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, twoway_t>` is true. The type of `E1` satisfies the `BaseExecutor` requirements and provides member functions such that calls to `require`, `prefer`, `context`, `execute` and `bulk_execute` are forwarded to the corresponding member functions of the copy of `E`, if present. In addition, if `E` satisfies the `OneWayExecutor` requirements, `E1` shall satisfy the `TwoWayExecutor` requirements by implementing `twoway_execute` in terms of `execute`. Similarly, if `E` satisfies the `BulkOneWayExecutor` requirements, `E1` shall satisfy the `BulkTwoWayExecutor` requirements by implementing `bulk_twoway_execute` in terms of `bulk_execute`. For some type `T`, the type yielded by `executor_future_t<decltype(E1), T>` is `std::experimental::future<T>`. `E1` has the same executor properties as `E`, except for the addition of the `twoway_t` property.

* Otherwise, a value `E1` of unspecified type that holds a copy of `E` if `N == 0` and `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, bulk_t>` is true. The type of `E1` satisfies the `BaseExecutor` requirements and provides member functions such that calls to `require`, `prefer`, `context`, `execute` and `twoway_execute` are forwarded to the corresponding member functions of the copy of `E`, if present. In addition, if `E` satisfies the `OneWayExecutor` requirements, `E1` shall satisfy the `BulkExecutor` requirements by implementing `bulk_execute` in terms of `execute`. If `E` also satisfies the `TwoWayExecutor` requirements, `E1` shall satisfy the `BulkTwoWayExecutor` requirements by implementing `bulk_twoway_execute` in terms of `bulk_execute`. `E1` has the same executor properties as `E`, except for the addition of the `bulk_t` property.

* Otherwise, a value `E1` of unspecified type that holds a copy of `E` if `N == 0` and `is_same<decay_t<decltype(P0)>, always_blocking_t>` is true. The type of `E1` satisfies the `BaseExecutor` requirements and provides member functions such that calls to `require`, `prefer`, `context`, `execute`, `twoway_execute`, `bulk_execute`, and `bulk_twoway_execute` are forwarded to the corresponding member functions of the copy of `E`, if present. In addition, `E1` provides an overload of `require` that returns a copy of `E1`, and all functions `execute`, `twoway_execute`, `bulk_execute`, and `bulk_twoway_execute` shall block the calling thread until the submitted functions have finished execution. `E1` has the same executor properties as `E`, except for the addition of the `always_blocking_t` property, and removal of `never_blocking_t` and `possibly_blocking_t` properties if present.

* Otherwise, `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::require( std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::require(E, P0), Pn...)` if `N > 0` and the expression is well formed.

* Otherwise, `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::require(E, P0, Pn...)` is ill-formed.

### `prefer`

    namespace {
      constexpr unspecified prefer = unspecified;
    }

The name `prefer` denotes a customization point. The effect of the expression `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::prefer(E, P0, Pn...)` for some expressions `E` and `P0`, and where `Pn...` represents `N` expressions (where `N` is 0 or more), is equivalent to:

* `(E).prefer(P0)` if `N == 0` and `has_prefer_member_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>, decltype(P0)>` is true.

* Otherwise, `(E).require(P0)` if `N == 0` and `has_require_member_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>, decltype(P0)>` is true.

* Otherwise, `prefer(E, P0)` if `N == 0` and the expression is well formed.

* Otherwise, `E` if `N == 0`.

* Otherwise, `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::prefer( std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::prefer(E, P0), Pn...)` if the expression is well formed.

* Otherwise, `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::prefer(E, P0, Pn...)` is ill-formed.

### `query`

    namespace {
      constexpr unspecified query = unspecified;
    }

The name `query` denotes a customization point. The effect of the expression `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::query(E, P)` for some expressions `E` and `P` is equivalent to:

* `(E).query(P)` if `has_query_member_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>, decltype(P)>` is true.

* Otherwise, `(E).query(P)` if and `has_query_member_v<decay_t<decltype(E)>, decltype(P)>` is true.

* Otherwise, `query(E, P)` if the expression is well formed.

* Otherwise, `E`.

* Otherwise, `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::prefer(E, P)` if the expression is well formed.

* Otherwise, `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::prefer(E, P)` is ill-formed.

### Customization point type traits

    template<class Executor, class... Properties> struct can_require;
    template<class Executor, class... Properties> struct can_prefer;
    template<class Executor, class... Properties> struct can_query;

This sub-clause contains templates that may be used to query the properties of a type at compile time. Each of these templates is a UnaryTypeTrait (C++Std [meta.rqmts]) with a BaseCharacteristic of `true_type` if the corresponding condition is true, otherwise `false_type`.

| Template                   | Condition           | Preconditions  |
|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| `template<class T>` <br/>`struct can_require` | The expression `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::require( declval<const Executor>(), declval<Properties>()...)` is well formed. | `T` is a complete type. |
| `template<class T>` <br/>`struct can_prefer` | The expression `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::prefer( declval<const Executor>(), declval<Properties>()...)` is well formed. | `T` is a complete type. |
| `template<class T>` <br/>`struct can_query` | The expression `std::experimental::concurrency_v2::execution::query( declval<const Executor>(), declval<Properties>()...)` is well formed. | `T` is a complete type. |

## Polymorphic executor wrappers

### Class `bad_executor`

An exception of type `bad_executor` is thrown by `executor` member functions `execute`, `twoway_execute`, `bulk_execute`, and `bulk_twoway_execute` when the executor object has no target.

```
class bad_executor : public exception
{
public:
  // constructor:
  bad_executor() noexcept;
};
```

#### `bad_executor` constructors

```
bad_executor() noexcept;
```

*Effects:* Constructs a `bad_executor` object.

*Postconditions:* `what()` returns an implementation-defined NTBS.

### Class `executor`

The `executor` class satisfies the `BaseExecutor`, `DefaultConstructible` (C++Std [defaultconstructible]), and `CopyAssignable` (C++Std [copyassignable]) requirements.

[*Note:* To meet the `noexcept` requirements for executor copy constructors and move constructors, implementations may share a target between two or more `executor` objects. *--end note*]

The *target* is the executor object that is held by the wrapper.

### Class `executor::context_type`

The `executor::context_type` class provides a polymorphic wrapper for the execution context associated with a polymorphic executor.

```
class executor::context_type
{
public:
  context_type(const context_type&) = delete;
  context_type& operator=(const context_type&) = delete;
};

// executor context_type comparisons:

bool operator==(const executor::context_type& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
template<class Context> operator==(const executor::context_type& a, const Context& b) noexcept;
template<class Context> operator==(const Context& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
bool operator!=(const executor::context_type& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
template<class Context> operator!=(const executor::context_type& a, const Context& b) noexcept;
template<class Context> operator!=(const Context& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
```

The *target* is the execution context that is associated with the target of the `executor` that created the `context_type` wrapper.

#### `executor::context_type` comparisons

```
bool operator==(const executor::context_type& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
```

*Returns:*
- `true` if `!a` and `!b`;
- `true` if `a` and `b` share a target;
- `true` if `c` and `d` are the same type and `c == d`, where `c` is the target of `a` and `d` is the target of `b`;
- otherwise `false`.

```
template<class Context> operator==(const executor::context_type& a, const Context& b) noexcept;
```

*Returns:*
- `true` if `c` and `b` are the same type and `c == b`, where `c` is the target of `a`;
- otherwise `false`.

```
template<class Context> operator==(const Context& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
```

*Returns:* `b == a`.

```
bool operator!=(const executor::context_type& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
template<class Context> operator!=(const executor::context_type& a, const Context& b) noexcept;
template<class Context> operator!=(const Context& a, const executor::context_type& b) noexcept;
```

*Returns:* `!(a == b)`.

## Thread pools

Thread pools create execution agents which execute on threads without incurring the
overhead of thread creation and destruction whenever such agents are needed.

### Header `<thread_pool>` synopsis

```
namespace std {
namespace experimental {
inline namespace concurrency_v2 {

  class static_thread_pool;

} // inline namespace concurrency_v2
} // namespace experimental
} // namespace std
```

### Class `static_thread_pool`

`static_thread_pool` is a statically-sized thread pool which may be explicitly
grown via thread attachment. The `static_thread_pool` is expected to be created
with the use case clearly in mind with the number of threads known by the
creator. As a result, no default constructor is considered correct for
arbitrary use cases and `static_thread_pool` does not support any form of
automatic resizing.   

`static_thread_pool` presents an effectively unbounded input queue and the execution functions of `static_thread_pool`'s associated executors do not block on this input queue.

[*Note:* Because `static_thread_pool` provides parallel execution agents,
situations which require concurrent execution properties are not guaranteed
correctness. *--end note.*]

```
class static_thread_pool
{
  public:
    using executor_type = see-below;
    
    // construction/destruction
    explicit static_thread_pool(std::size_t num_threads);
    
    // nocopy
    static_thread_pool(const static_thread_pool&) = delete;
    static_thread_pool& operator=(const static_thread_pool&) = delete;

    // stop accepting incoming work and wait for work to drain
    ~static_thread_pool();

    // attach current thread to the thread pools list of worker threads
    void attach();

    // signal all work to complete
    void stop();

    // wait for all threads in the thread pool to complete
    void wait();

    // placeholder for a general approach to getting executors from 
    // standard contexts.
    executor_type executor() noexcept;
};

bool operator==(const static_thread_pool& a, const static_thread_pool& b) noexcept;
bool operator!=(const static_thread_pool& a, const static_thread_pool& b) noexcept;
```

The class `static_thread_pool` satisfies the `ExecutionContext` requirements.

For an object of type `static_thread_pool`, *outstanding work* is defined as the sum
of:

* the number of existing executor objects associated with the
  `static_thread_pool` for which the `execution::outstanding_work` property is
  established;

* the number of function objects that have been added to the `static_thread_pool`
  via the `static_thread_pool` executor, but not yet executed; and

* the number of function objects that are currently being executed by the
  `static_thread_pool`.

The `static_thread_pool` member functions `executor`, `attach`, `wait`, and
`stop`, and the associated executors' copy constructors and member functions,
do not introduce data races as a result of concurrent calls to those
functions from different threads of execution.

#### Types

```
using executor_type = see-below;
```

An executor type conforming to the specification for `static_thread_pool` executor types described below.

#### Construction and destruction

```
static_thread_pool(std::size_t num_threads);
```

*Effects:* Constructs a `static_thread_pool` object with `num_threads` threads of
execution, as if by creating objects of type `std::thread`.

```
~static_thread_pool();
```

*Effects:* Destroys an object of class `static_thread_pool`. Performs `stop()`
followed by `wait()`.

#### Worker management

```
void attach();
```

*Effects:* Adds the calling thread to the pool such that this thread is used to
execute submitted function objects. [*Note:* Threads created during thread pool
construction, or previously attached to the pool, will continue to be used for
function object execution. *--end note*] Blocks the calling thread until
signalled to complete by `stop()` or `wait()`, and then blocks until all the
threads created during `static_thread_pool` object construction have completed.
(NAMING: a possible alternate name for this function is `join()`.)

```
void stop();
```

*Effects:* Signals the threads in the pool to complete as soon as possible. If
a thread is currently executing a function object, the thread will exit only
after completion of that function object. The call to `stop()` returns without
waiting for the threads to complete. Subsequent calls to attach complete
immediately.

```
void wait();
```

*Effects:* If not already stopped, signals the threads in the pool to complete
once the outstanding work is `0`. Blocks the calling thread (C++Std
[defns.block]) until all threads in the pool have completed, without executing
submitted function objects in the calling thread. Subsequent calls to attach
complete immediately.

*Synchronization:* The completion of each thread in the pool synchronizes with
(C++Std [intro.multithread]) the corresponding successful `wait()` return.

#### Executor creation

```
executor_type executor() noexcept;
```

*Returns:* An executor that may be used to submit function objects to the
thread pool. The returned executor has the following properties already
established:

  * `execution::oneway`
  * `execution::twoway`
  * `execution::then`
  * `execution::single`
  * `execution::bulk`
  * `execution::possibly_blocking`
  * `execution::not_continuation`
  * `execution::not_outstanding_work`
  * `execution::allocator(std::allocator<void>())`

#### Comparisons

```
bool operator==(const static_thread_pool& a, const static_thread_pool& b) noexcept;
```

*Returns:* `std::addressof(a) == std::addressof(b)`.

```
bool operator!=(const static_thread_pool& a, const static_thread_pool& b) noexcept;
```

*Returns:* `!(a == b)`.

### `static_thread_pool` executor types
