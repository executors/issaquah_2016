abstract: |
  \noindent This paper is a companion to [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443) and describes the executors programming model it specifies.
  \noindent This paper is directed towards readers who want to understand in detail the mechanics of P0443's programming model, and the rationale underpinning the choices of that model's design.
  \noindent Readers who want a quick overview of the basics of using executors in typical use cases should refer to [DXXXX](http://wg21.link/DXXXX).
  Note: This paper is an early draft. It's known to be incomplete and incorrect, and it has lots of bad formatting.
